# Workout Logger — Product Requirements Document

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** March 31, 2026
**Package:** `com.ayogeshwaran.workoutlogger`
**Status:** Released

---

## 1. Overview

Workout Logger is a lightweight, offline-first Android app that helps users log their workouts every single day. The app makes it effortless to record what you did, when you did it, and look back at your workout history on any past date. No accounts, no cloud, no bloat — just a fast daily workout log that works out of the box.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

People want to stay consistent with their fitness routine but often lose track of what they did, when they did it, or how consistent they've been over weeks and months. Most fitness apps on the market are overloaded with features — social feeds, meal plans, subscription paywalls — when all the user really wants is a quick way to say "I worked out today" and check what they did last Tuesday or a year ago. There is a clear need for a minimal, fast, offline-first workout logger that does one thing and does it well.

---

## 3. Target Users

- Anyone who works out regularly and wants a no-friction daily log.
- Users who prefer a minimal, no-account-required app that works entirely offline.
- Fitness enthusiasts who want to look back at their workout history over weeks, months, or years.

---

## 4. Goals

| Goal | Measure |
|------|---------|
| Log a workout with minimal effort | Under 5 seconds: tap a type → confirm → done |
| Browse full workout history | Calendar view with indicators; tap any date to see details |
| Work offline by default | All data in local Room database; no network required |
| Support future extensibility | Clean architecture with separated layers; backend can be added without touching UI or business logic |

---

## 5. Tech Stack

| Area | Technology |
|------|------------|
| Language | Kotlin |
| UI Framework | Jetpack Compose |
| Design System | Material 3 (Material You) with dynamic color |

---

## 6. Architecture

The project follows **clean architecture** with three clearly separated layers. Each layer has a single direction of dependency. This ensures any layer can be modified, tested, or extended independently — and is critical for plugging in a backend later without rewriting the app.

### 6.3 Backend Readiness

The `domain/repository/WorkoutRepository` interface is the **boundary**. The presentation layer never knows where data comes from — it only talks to use cases, which talk to the repository interface.

When a backend is introduced in the future:

1. Add API service and remote data source classes in `data/remote/`.
2. Update `WorkoutRepositoryImpl` to coordinate between local (Room) and remote (API) — e.g., cache-first strategy, background sync.
3. **Zero changes** needed in the domain or presentation layers.

---

## 7. Data Model

### 7.1 Room Entity — `WorkoutEntryEntity`

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | `Int` | Primary key, auto-generated |
| `workoutCategory` | `String` | Category the workout belongs to — `"cardio"` or `"gym"` |
| `workoutType` | `String` | The specific workout type (e.g., `"Running"`, `"Chest"`, `"Biceps"`) |
| `date` | `Long` | Epoch milliseconds normalized to midnight — used for grouping and querying by calendar day |
| `timestamp` | `Long` | Epoch milliseconds for the exact date + time the user selected |
| `createdAt` | `Long` | Epoch milliseconds when the record was actually inserted into the database |

### 7.2 Domain Model — `WorkoutEntry`

Mirrors the entity fields but is a **plain Kotlin data class** with no Room annotations and no Android dependencies. Mapping between entity and domain model happens exclusively inside `WorkoutRepositoryImpl`.

A companion enum-like sealed class or string constants define the two categories:
- `WorkoutCategory.CARDIO` — Running, Cycling, Swimming, Walking, HIIT, Yoga, Stretching
- `WorkoutCategory.GYM` — Chest, Back, Shoulders, Biceps, Triceps, Legs, Abs, Full Body

### 7.3 DAO Operations — `WorkoutDao`

| Method | Return Type | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `insertWorkout(entry)` | `Unit` | Insert a new workout entry |
| `deleteWorkout(entry)` | `Unit` | Delete a workout entry by ID |
| `getWorkoutsForDate(startOfDay, endOfDay)` | `Flow<List<WorkoutEntryEntity>>` | All workouts where `date` falls within the given day |
| `getDatesWithWorkouts()` | `Flow<List<Long>>` | All distinct `date` values that have at least one workout |
| `getWorkoutsInRange(start, end)` | `Flow<List<WorkoutEntryEntity>>` | All workouts within a date range (for loading a calendar month) |

All query methods return `Flow` so the UI automatically reacts to database changes.

---

## 8. Screens & User Experience

The app has two primary screens connected by a Material 3 bottom navigation bar, and one secondary screen (About) accessible via an info icon.

### 8.1 Home Screen — "Today"

This is the default screen the user sees when they open the app. It is designed for speed — log a workout in a few taps.

#### Info Icon

- A subtle `ℹ️` icon button is displayed at the top-right of the screen.
- Tapping it navigates to the **About** screen (secondary navigation — not part of the bottom bar).

#### Date & Time Header

- Displays today's date and the current time prominently at the top.
- **Tapping the date** opens a Material 3 `DatePickerDialog`. It defaults to today but allows the user to select any date (past or future).
- **Tapping the time** opens a Material 3 `TimePickerDialog`. It defaults to the current time but allows the user to customize.
- The selected date and time are used when saving the workout entry. If the user doesn't touch them, the entry saves with "right now."

#### Workout Type Selector

- Workout types are organized into **two categories** displayed as labeled sections.
- Each category is a horizontally scrollable row (or a flow layout that wraps) of Material 3 `FilterChip` components.
- A small Material 3 `titleSmall` label above each row identifies the category.

**Category 1 — Cardio & General**

| Chip Label | Emoji |
|------------|-------|
| Running | 🏃 |
| Cycling | 🚴 |
| Swimming | 🏊 |
| Walking | 🚶 |
| HIIT | ⚡ |
| Yoga | 🧘 |
| Stretching | 🤸 |

**Category 2 — Gym / Muscle Groups**

| Chip Label | Emoji |
|------------|-------|
| Chest | 🫁 |
| Back | 🔙 |
| Shoulders | 💪 |
| Biceps | 💪 |
| Triceps | 💪 |
| Legs | 🦵 |
| Abs | 🧱 |
| Full Body | 🏋️ |

- Single selection — tapping one chip selects it and deselects the previous (across both categories).
- The selected chip uses Material 3's selected `FilterChip` style (filled tonal with checkmark).

#### Log Workout Button

- A prominent Material 3 `Button` (filled) labeled **"Log Workout"**.
- Enabled only when a workout type is selected.
- On tap:
  - Saves the selected workout type + chosen date/time to Room.
  - Clears the chip selection.
  - Shows a Material 3 `Snackbar`: **"Workout logged!"** with an **"Undo"** action.
  - The new entry immediately appears in the list below (Room Flow triggers recomposition).

#### Today's Workout List

- A `LazyColumn` below the input area listing all workouts logged for the currently displayed date.
- Each item is a Material 3 `ElevatedCard` showing:
  - The workout type emoji and label (e.g., "🏃 Running").
  - The time it was logged (e.g., "2:30 PM").
- **Swipe-to-delete**: swiping a card to the left reveals a delete action. On completion:
  - The entry is deleted from Room.
  - A `Snackbar` shows **"Workout deleted"** with **"Undo"**.
- **Swipe-to-delete onboarding tooltip**: on first launch, a tinted tip card appears above the workout list when at least one workout exists: *"💡 Tip: Swipe left on a workout to delete it"* with a **"Got it"** dismiss button. Dismissal is persisted via `SharedPreferences` and never shown again.
- **Empty state**: when no workouts exist for the selected date, show a centered message:
  > "No workouts logged yet. Let's get moving! 💪"

### 8.2 History Screen — "History"

This screen lets users browse their entire workout history through a calendar interface.

#### Calendar View

- A custom-built month-grid calendar composable (7 columns × 5–6 rows).
- Shows the current month by default.
- **Dot indicators**: dates that have at least one logged workout display a small colored dot (primary color) below the date number.
- **Date selection**: tapping a date highlights it and loads that day's workouts in the list below.
- **Today indicator**: today's date always has a distinct outline/ring regardless of selection.
- **Month navigation**: left and right `IconButton` arrows in the header to navigate between months. The header shows the month and year (e.g., "February 2026").
- This allows users to navigate to any past date — even a year ago — and see exactly what they did.

#### Selected Date's Workout List

- Same `LazyColumn` card style as the home screen.
- A date header above the list shows the full selected date (e.g., **"Saturday, February 28, 2026"**).
- All workouts for the selected date are listed.
- Users can swipe-to-delete entries here as well.
- **Empty state** for a date with no workouts:
  > "No workouts on this day."

### 8.3 Bottom Navigation Bar

- Material 3 `NavigationBar` with two destinations:

| Tab | Label | Icon | Route |
|-----|-------|------|-------|
| 1 | Today | `Icons.Default.Home` | `home` |
| 2 | History | `Icons.Default.DateRange` | `history` |

- Follows Material 3 `NavigationBar` guidelines: icon + label, active indicator pill.
- Preserves scroll position and state when switching between tabs.
- The bottom bar is **hidden** when the user navigates to the About screen.

### 8.4 About Screen — Secondary Navigation

Accessible via the `ℹ️` info icon on the Home screen. Not part of the bottom navigation bar. Includes a `TopAppBar` with a back arrow to return.

#### Sections

1. **App header** — App icon emoji, app name (from `strings.xml`), version (read dynamically from `PackageManager`).
2. **Philosophy card** — *"Everyone deserves simple tools."* with a short description of the app's ethos.
3. **Developer card** — Developer name (from `strings.xml`), personal note.
4. **Actions:**
   - **Send Feedback** — `OutlinedButton` that opens the user's email app via `ACTION_SENDTO` with the developer email (from `strings.xml`) and subject pre-filled.
   - **Rate on Play Store** — `OutlinedButton` that opens the Play Store listing using `context.packageName` (dynamically resolved, no hardcoding).
5. **Open Source Licenses** — A list of all runtime libraries used by the app, each displayed as an `ElevatedCard` with name and license type. All current dependencies are Apache License 2.0.

#### Dynamic Values

All configurable values are centralized — **nothing is hardcoded in composables**:

| Value | Source |
|-------|--------|
| App name | `strings.xml` → `R.string.app_name` |
| Developer name | `strings.xml` → `R.string.developer_name` |
| Developer email | `strings.xml` → `R.string.developer_email` |
| Feedback subject | `strings.xml` → `R.string.feedback_subject` |
| App version | `PackageManager.getPackageInfo()` at runtime |
| Package ID (Play Store link) | `context.packageName` at runtime |

---

## 9. Theme & Visual Design

### 9.1 Material You / Dynamic Color

- **Android 12+ (API 31+):** Use `dynamicLightColorScheme(context)` and `dynamicDarkColorScheme(context)` to derive the entire color scheme from the user's wallpaper. This gives the app a personal, native feel on modern devices.
- **Android 11 and below:** Fall back to the custom seed color palette defined below.
- **Light/Dark mode:** Follows the system setting automatically. Both modes are fully supported.

### 9.2 Seed Color Palette (Fallback for API < 31)

A fitness-oriented palette — teal/green conveys health and vitality, amber provides warmth for accents and interactive elements.

| Color Role | Light Mode | Dark Mode |
|------------|------------|-----------|
| Primary | `#2E7D6F` (Teal Green) | `#80CBC4` (Light Teal) |
| On Primary | `#FFFFFF` | `#00332C` |
| Primary Container | `#B2DFDB` | `#00513D` |
| Secondary | `#FFA726` (Amber) | `#FFD54F` (Light Amber) |
| On Secondary | `#FFFFFF` | `#3E2C00` |
| Secondary Container | `#FFE0B2` | `#5C4200` |
| Background | `#FAFAFA` | `#1C1C1E` |
| Surface | `#FFFFFF` | `#1C1C1E` |
| On Surface | `#1C1C1E` | `#E6E1E5` |
| Error | `#D32F2F` | `#EF9A9A` |
| On Error | `#FFFFFF` | `#601410` |

### 9.3 Typography

- Use the Material 3 default type scale from `androidx.compose.material3.Typography`.
- Body text: system default (Roboto on most devices).
- Screen titles: `titleLarge` with medium weight.
- Card content: `bodyMedium` for workout type, `bodySmall` for time.
- No custom fonts in v1 — keeps the APK small and consistent with system style.

### 9.4 Consistency Rules

These rules must be followed across all screens to maintain a cohesive look and feel:

1. **All UI components are Material 3** — no mixing of Material 2 (`androidx.compose.material`) and Material 3 (`androidx.compose.material3`). Import only from `material3`.
2. **No hardcoded colors in composables** — every color must come from `MaterialTheme.colorScheme`. This ensures dynamic color and dark mode work correctly.
3. **Consistent spacing:**
   - Screen horizontal padding: `16.dp`
   - Vertical gap between sections: `16.dp`
   - Gap between list items: `8.dp`
   - Internal card padding: `16.dp`
4. **Consistent corner shapes:** Use Material 3 shape defaults. Do not override `RoundedCornerShape` manually unless absolutely necessary.
5. **Consistent elevation:** Use `ElevatedCard` for workout items (default M3 elevation). Use `Scaffold` for screen structure.

## 13. Out of Scope — v1

The following are explicitly **not** part of the v1 release:

- ❌ User accounts or authentication
- ❌ Cloud sync or backend integration (architecture supports it; not built yet)
- ❌ Custom / user-created workout types (presets only)
- ❌ Workout details — duration, sets, reps, distance, notes
- ❌ Push notifications or daily reminders
- ❌ Data export / import (CSV, JSON)
- ❌ Home screen widget
- ❌ Statistics, charts, or streak tracking
- ❌ Multi-language / localization

---

## 14. Future Roadmap — v2 and Beyond

These features are out of scope for v1 but the architecture is designed to support them cleanly:

| Feature | How the Architecture Supports It |
|---------|----------------------------------|
| **Backend sync** | Add `data/remote/` with API service + remote data source. Update `WorkoutRepositoryImpl` to sync local ↔ remote. Zero changes to domain or presentation. |
| **Custom workout types** | Add a `WorkoutType` entity + DAO + domain model. Add a "Manage Types" screen in presentation. The existing `workoutType: String` field already stores the name. |
| **Workout details** (duration, notes, sets) | Add nullable fields to `WorkoutEntryEntity` and `WorkoutEntry`. Update the Home screen to show optional input fields. |
| **Statistics dashboard** | Add new use cases (`GetWeeklyStatsUseCase`, `GetStreakUseCase`). Add a new "Stats" tab in bottom navigation. |
